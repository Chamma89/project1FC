# Tic Tac Toe


### Approach
The approach i took was to first create the grid using css and then figuring out how to select each box individually using the DOM. Once that was done, i started on the logic of the game.

### Struggles
With slight DOM experience, it was an obstacle to select and add an image into the boxes.
Adding a reset button was a first for me. 
After the heavy win/loss logic i provided, it was a challenge to include a draw option. With a bit of help, i learnt a new technique using includes and !result. 

### Lessons Learned
I would approach the next project by leaving the CSS till last. Working on the methods and logic of the game. Booleans are crucial and are very useful in the game.
